Description: Analyze the "activities" of mutational signatures in one or more mutational spectra.
    'mSigAct' stands for mutational Signature Activity. mSigAct uses a maximum likelihood approach
    to estimate (conservatively) whether there is evidence that a particular set of mutational 
    signatures is present in a spectrum. It can also determine a *minimal* subset of signatures 
    needed to plausibly reconstruct an observed spectrum. This sparse assign signatures 
    functionality is *deliberately biased* toward using as few signatures as possible. There is 
    also functionality to do a maximum a posteriori estimate of signature activity, which makes 
    use of information on the proportion of tumors in a given type that have a particular 
    signature combined with the likelihood that a particular combination of signatures generated
    an observed spectrum.
