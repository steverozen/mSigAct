)
}
\arguments{
\item{spect}{A single spectrum.}

\item{reference.exp}{Compare the inferred exposures to this.}

\item{cancer.type}{Character string from a fixed set indicating
different cancer types, used to look up the set of signatures
known in that cancer type and the proportion of cancers of that
type that have the signature. TODO: provide information on
how to find the allowed cancer types.}

\item{mutation.type}{One of "SBS96", "SBS192", "ID", "DBS78".}

\item{exposure.mutation.type}{One of "SBS96", "ID", "DBS78".}

\item{max.subsets}{The maximum number of subsets that can be
tested for removal from the set of signatures.}

\item{max.level}{The maximum number of signatures to try removing.}

\item{max.mc.cores}{The maximum number of cores to use.
On Microsoft Windows machines it is silently changed to 1.}

\item{m.opts}{See \code{\link{DefaultManyOpts}}.}

\item{out.dir}{If non-NULL create this directory if necessary and put
results there.}

\item{p.thresh}{If
the p value for a better reconstruction with than without a set of signatures
is > than \code{p.thresh}, then we can use exposures without this set.}

\item{max.presence.proportion}{The maximum value of the proportion
of tumors that must have a given signature. Used so that it is
possible to exclude a signature from a spectrum, e.g.
perhaps all examples of tumor types have SBS5, but we want
to allow a small chance that SBS5 is not present.}

\item{sigs.prop}{The proportions of samples that contain each
signature. A numerical vector (values between 0 and 1), with names
being signature identifiers. Can be the
return value from \code{\link{ExposureProportions}}.}

\item{sigs}{Matrix of signatures.}
