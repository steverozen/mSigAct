\title{Return the proportions of tumors of a given cancer type that have a particular signature}
\usage{
ExposureProportions(
  mutation.type,
  cancer.type,
  all.sigs = NULL,
  drop.sigs.no.info = TRUE,
  must.include = character(),
  must.include.prop = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mutation.type}{A character string, one of "SBS96", "SBS192", "ID", 
"DBS78".}

\item{cancer.type}{A character string. For some common cancer types, see
\code{\link{CancerTypes}} for more details.}

\item{all.sigs}{An optional matrix of known signatures, 
with column names being signatures ids. Only used to drop 
signatures not present in \code{all.sigs}.}

\item{drop.sigs.no.info}{If TRUE, drop signatures not present in 
the column names of \code{all.sigs}.}

\item{must.include}{A character vector of signature IDs that
must be included, even if they have not previously been
observed in that cancer type. The associated proportion is
specified by \code{must.include.prop}.}

\item{must.include.prop}{The value used for the expected proportion of
signatures in \code{must.include} but not previously observed
in the given \code{cancer.type}.}
}
\value{
A numerical vector of the proportion of 
  tumors of type \code{cancer.type} with each signature
  for those signatures observed in \code{cancer.type}. 
  The names are the signature ids.
}
\description{
Return the proportions of tumors of a given cancer type that have a particular signature
